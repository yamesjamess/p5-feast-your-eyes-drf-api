![Feast Your Eyes](documentation/supporting_images/root.png)

Feast Your Eyes DRF API â€“ a robust data management solution leveraging the capabilities of Django Rest Framework. This API ensures seamless communication between your backend and React front end, streamlining resource management with efficiency. With Feast Your Eyes API, you can effortlessly handle the creation, updating, and deletion of resources, all while adhering to RESTful principles.

Notably, the API's capability for smooth JSON data transmission stands out, providing a standardized format for exchanging information between backend and frontend components. This feature enhances the overall responsiveness of your application, contributing to a more streamlined and user-friendly experience.

## Design

### Entity-Relationship for the Database

- The ER model is created on **Lucidchart**

* Profile
  - The Profile model has a 1 to 1 relationship with User model. Because of the signal in the Profile model. A User object is created when Profile is created.
  - The Profile Model has a one to many relationship with Follower, as one profile can follow many profiles.
* User
  - The User model has a one to many relationship with Follower, as one profile can have many followers.
  - The User model has a one to many relationship with Like, as one profile can have many likes.
  - The User model has a one to many relationship with Recommend, as one profile can have many recommendations.
  - The User model has a one to many relationship with Comment, as one profile can have many comments.
  - The User model has a one to many relationship with Post, as one profile can have many posts.
* Post
  - The Post model has a many to one relationship with Likes, as one post can have many likes.
  - The Post model has a many to one relationship with Recommend, as one post can have many recommendations.
  - The Post model has a many to one relationship with Comment, as one post can have many comments.

## Planning

- The Github Project and Issues was utilise to facilitate the Agile Development Methodology. User Stories were created from User Stories template with acceptance criteria. The development process was aided by Kanban board feature of the Project to visualise what needs to be worked on and what is completed. All the User Stories are linked to EPICs to show how to support each other and what must be achieved to complete development goals.

The EPICs, User Stories, and Kanban Board can be viewd here : [Feast Your Eyes Agile Development Tool](https://github.com/users/yamesjamess/projects/8)
